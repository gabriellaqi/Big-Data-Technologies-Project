Word count of tweets, blogs, and news articles dataset to see the difference of frequently used words

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/crmercado/tweets-blogs-news-swiftkey-dataset-4million#de_DE.twitter.txt

Question: 
(1)	When I first saw the dataset, I thought it could be interesting to figure out what are the most frequently used words for Americans in their daily life.
(2)	I was also wondering if there would be any difference among the words used in tweets, blogs, and news articles. 
(3)	I use Twitter a lot and it can only type in 140 characters at a time, which could be annoyed sometimes, so I was also curious if this character limit would do any change to people’s language. 
(4)	In addition, as more and more young generations are into using abbreviations, such as idk, lol, idr, nbd…, maybe I could see if those innovative language are increasingly used. 
(5)	Furthermore, derived from the results, there could be potential suggestions and innovative thoughts about implementing future predictive text application.
